#  Huge Payout for Single Number in Roulette

There is a huge payout for a single number in roulette. If you are looking to make some serious money, then roulette is the game for you. There are a number of different ways to play, but the most common is betting on a single number.

The payout for a single number is 35 to 1. This means that if you bet $10 on a single number and it comes up, you will get paid $350. This is a huge payout, and it can be quite profitable if you know how to play the game correctly.

There are a few things to keep in mind when playing roulette. First, make sure that you bet on one of the even money bets, such as black or red, or high or low. These bets have a lower house edge than the other bets, so they are your best option if you want to make money.

Second, don’t bet too much money on any one bet. It’s always a good idea to spread your bets out so that you don’t lose all your money in one go. Finally, remember that the odds of winning are not great, so don’t expect to win every time. However, with a little bit of luck and some smart betting strategies, you can make some serious profits from roulette.

A roulette player in Macau lost HK$80,000 (US$10,000)within 10 minutes after hitting a number four times in a row at the casino, according to local media.

The unlucky gambler was playing at the StarWorld Hotel and Casino when he placed a HK$1,000 (US$128) bet on number four, which came up each time. The casino pays out 36 to one for such a payout.

“The player told us that he had been feeling lucky and decided to bet big on number four. Unfortunately for him, the luck ran out!” said a spokesperson from the StarWorld Hotel and Casino.

This isn’t the first time that an unlucky player has lost a large sum of money in a short space of time. In 2013, a British man lost £170,000 (US$269,000) in two hours at the same casino after betting on number 13.
