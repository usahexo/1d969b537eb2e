#  Lietkabelis poker chips have high value on the market! 

Lietkabelis poker chips are one of the rarest poker chip denominations in the world. They have a high value on the market, and are often collected by avid casino enthusiasts.

Casinos started issuing Lietkabelis poker chips in 2004. The chips were produced in limited quantities, and as a result, they are now quite rare. In fact, there are only about 100 sets of Lietkabelis poker chips in existence today.

Due to their rarity and high value, Lietkabelis poker chips are often auctioned off online. In fact, a set of four Lietkabelis chips was sold for over $1,700 on eBay in 2011.

So why are Lietkabelis poker chips so sought after?

Well, first of all, they are quite unique. Unlike most other casino poker chips, which are typically made from plastic or clay, Lietkabelis chips are made from metal. This gives them a distinctive look and feel that sets them apart from other denominations.

Second, the design of the Lietkabelis chip is quite interesting. It features the Lithuanian coat of arms on one side and an image of a knight on horseback on the other. This makes them a popular collectible among casino enthusiasts who appreciate unique designs and regional flair.

Finally, the limited supply of Lietkabelis poker chips means that they are highly coveted by collectors. Whereas other denominations can be found at casinos all over the world, Lietkabelis chips are much harder to come by. So if youâ€™re looking for a truly unique and valuable casino collectible, then consider picking up a set of Lietkabelis poker chips!
