We’re excited to introduce the cast of our newest Bingo Blitz commercial – Delaware! This lively group is made up of six friends who bonded over their shared love of bingo and have been playing together ever since.

First up is Barb, the spunky organizer of the group who loves nothing more than a good game of bingo. She likes to keep things moving and always has a positive attitude, which is infectious among her friends.

Next is Brenda, the life of the party and undisputed bingo champion of the group. She’s always up for a good time and is never afraid to take on a challenge, especially when it comes to bingo.

Then there’s Carl, the jokester of the group who loves to make everyone laugh. He’s always game for a round of bingo (or two), no matter how challenging it may be.

Dawn is the levelheaded one of the group, and is often the voice of reason when things get chaotic. She’s a dedicated player who takes her bingo seriously – but she also knows how to have fun.

Earl is the oldest member of the group, but that doesn’t stop him from being just as enthusiastic about bingo as anyone else. He’s been playing for years and has instilled his love for the game in his friends.

Lastly, there’s Fran, the newbie of the group who’s still trying to learn all there is to know about bingo. But she’s eager to learn and always up for a challenge, so she fits right in with this motley crew.

We had a blast filming this commercial with these six amazing people – we hope you enjoy watching it as much as we enjoyed making it!
