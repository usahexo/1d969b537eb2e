#  What is the betting tutorial for Instant Horses?

Instant Horses is the perfect game for people who love to gamble and want to make some money on the side. In this tutorial, we will teach you how to bet on horses like a pro!

The first step is to familiarize yourself with the different types of bets. There are six types of bets you can place in Instant Horses: win, place, show, exacta, quinella, and trifecta. A win bet is simply wagering on a horse to win the race. A place bet is betting that your horse will finish either first or second. A show bet is betting that your horse will finish in either first, second, or third place. An exacta bet is when you pick the two horses that will finish first and second in any order. A quinella bet is picking the two horses that will finish first and second but they do not have to be in any order. Lastly, a trifecta bet is picking the three horses that will finish first, second, and third in any order.

Once you understand the different types of bets available, it’s time to start studying the horses! You want to look at things like their odds, their recent race history, and even their jockey and trainer. Some people might think that just because a horse has high odds it must be a good pick, but this isn’t always true. Sometimes a longshot can payout big if it happens to win, but it’s important to do your research before placing any bets.

Once you’ve selected which horses you want to bet on, it’s time to place your bets! You can do this by going into the “My Bets” tab under “My Account” and then selecting the race you are betting on. There are three possible outcomes for each race: Win (W), Place (P), or Show (S). Simply enter how much money you want to wager on each outcome and then hit submit!

And that’s all there is to betting on horses with Instant Horses! Keep these tips in mind next time you visit the track and watch those payouts roll in!
