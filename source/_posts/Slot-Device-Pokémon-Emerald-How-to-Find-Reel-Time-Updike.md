#  Slot Device Tips for Pokémon Emerald: Catch Reel Time Updike!

_ So you've finally completed the main story line of Pokémon Emerald and are looking for ways to get ahead. Here are some tips for utilizing the slot devices in the Battle Tower._

#1 Get your Berry fix early on

The first thing you'll want to do is max out your Berries. To do this, play the slot devices in the second row from the bottom on the right side. Bet a single Coin and line up three Cherries to get a Berry. Do this ten times and you'll have maxed out your Berry supply. This will come in handy later on when trying to catch Reel Time Updike, an extremely powerful Trainer featured in the Battle Tower.

#2 Save your Coins for Reel Time Updike


 Now that you've got your Berries maxed out, it's time to start saving up your Coins for Reel Time Updike. He's a difficult opponent, but can be beaten with enough perseverance. The key to defeating him is using strong Pokémon that can deal massive damage quickly. Make sure you're well stocked up on healing items as well, as you'll likely take a lot of damage during the battle.

#3 Use strong Type match-ups

 Another important factor in defeating Reel Time Updike is using Pokémon with strong Type match-ups. For example, Fire Types are super effective against Grass Types, which is one of Reel Time Updike's weakest types. You'll also want to avoid using weak Pokémon that won't stand a chance against his high-powered team.

With these tips in mind, you should be well on your way to beating Reel Time Updike and claiming your spot at the top of the Battle Tower!

#  Catching Reel Time Updike in Pokémon Emerald: Slot Device Strategy

Ahead of Pokémon: Let’s Move, I had revenged my surrendered DS Lite game cartridge by playing through the Emerald port on my old GBA SP. It was as if the developers knew what they were doing when they ported it over- the Virtual Console release on the Wii U didn’t compare, even if I caught most of my team there. Anyway, that playthrough got me thinking about a somewhat overlooked detail in Pokémon Emerald- catching Reel Time Updike.

Updike is a Water-type Pokémon with the ability to reel in prey much faster than other aquatic creatures. He can be found in the final room of Meteor Falls, but he’s a rare catch. To make things more difficult, he has a 4% chance of appearing in battle and an even slimmer chance of being captured. So how do you snag this slippery fish?

The answer is simple- use a slot machine strategy. Updike is one of only two non-legendary Pokémon that can be caught with this method (the other being Wynaut), so it’s well worth your time to learn how it works. There are dozens of guides online that will explain the specifics, but here’s the gist:

1) Save your game before entering Meteor Falls.

2) Enter and exit the room until Updike appears. He has a random chance to appear in any battle, so you may have to try multiple times.

3) Use a critical hit move (like Waterfall or Surf) to weaken him as much as possible before trying to capture him. If possible, try to avoid inflicting any status effects like poison or sleep.

4) Use a ball that has at least a 10% catch rate for Water-types (like Ultra Balls or Dive Balls). If you don’t have any of those balls, save your game and then reset if Updike escapes.

5) Slot machine strategy: enter the battle with three coins inserted into the machines. If Updike breaks free, reset and try again. If he’s caught, walk away from the machines without collecting your prize (you should get TM42- Facade). Then reenter Meteor Falls and repeat steps 2-5 until you have enough coins for another go at capturing Updike.

It may seem like a lot of work, but it’s definitely worth it to add an extra water Pokémon to your team. Good luck!
