#  Lakers Star Injured in Casino Game; Lakers Seek Fifth Title Without Him

 Lakers forward Paul George suffered a severe ankle injury in what officials are calling an “accidental fall” at the Thousand Oaks Casino on Sunday night.

The extent of the injury is not yet known, but Lakers management is reportedly negotiating with the casino to release footage of the incident in order to clarify what exactly happened.

In a statement released by the team, Lakers management said they were “saddened and disappointed” by George’s injury and that they would be seeking their fifth title without him.

George, who was acquired by the Lakers in a trade with Oklahoma City last offseason, averaged 21 points and 7 rebounds per game this season. He is scheduled to become a free agent in 2020.

#  Lakers Lose Another One as Kobe Goes Down with Injury

The Lakers have now lost their second game in a row, this time against the Pelicans with Kobe Bryant suffering from a rotator cuff injury.

This is not good news for the Lakers who are trying to make it to the playoffs this year. Kobe has been playing really well this season and has been one of the main reasons why the Lakers have been doing so well.

Losing Kobe for an extended period of time would be a major blow to the Lakers and could mean that they won’t make it to the playoffs this year. This would be a huge disappointment for Kobe and the Lakers organization.

Kobe is scheduled to have surgery on his shoulder and will be out for an extended period of time. This is a huge setback for him and the Lakers and we will have to wait and see how they do without him.

#  What Does sr Mean for the LA Lakers?

Since Magic Johnson took over as President of Basketball Operations for the Lakers, one of the main goals has been to sign superstar small forward LeBron James in free agency.

To create cap space for James, the Lakers renounced their rights to Julius Randle, Brook Lopez and Luol Deng. Lopez and Deng were both starters last season. Randle, who was a starter for most of last season, came off the bench in the last few games of the season and in the playoffs.

The Lakers then signed Lance Stephenson, JaVale McGee and Rajon Rondo; all three are veterans who have played with James in the past.

These signings left the Lakers with just $4.36 million in cap space. This is why they were not able to re-sign restricted free agent Julius Randle.

Randle then agreed to a two-year, $18 million contract with the New Orleans Pelicans. This is a good deal for Randle because it gives him the opportunity to become an unrestricted free agent next summer when there will be more money available in free agency.

The Lakers also lost Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who agreed to a two-year, $16 million contract with the Los Angeles Clippers. The Lakers were not willing to match that salary because they needed to save money to try and sign LeBron James and other free agents.

With all of these moves, many people are wondering what sr means for the Lakers. Some people think that it stands for “Superman Returns” because LeBron James is taking over for Kobe Bryant as the face of the franchise. Other people think that sr stands for “senior staff member” because Magic Johnson has brought in a lot of old friends and former teammates to help him rebuild the Lakers.

What does sr mean for the Lakers? Only time will tell.

#  Will Lakers' Season be Ruined with Kobe Out?

When Kobe Bryant finally announced his retirement last week, the basketball world was in shock. It was no secret that Kobe was hinting at retirement in the later years, but the timing of it still came as a surprise to most people.

It was also revealed last week that Bryant has a serious rotator cuff tear and will require surgery, which means he is going to be out for 6-9 months. This could potentially mean the end of Lakers' season and further dampen Kobe's legacy.

The Lakers are currently in 10th place in the Western Conference with a record of 11-21. They are 5.5 games behind the 8th place Houston Rockets, who occupy the last playoff spot. With Kobe out for an extended period of time, it is going to be nearly impossible for them to make up that deficit.

Even if they do miraculously make the playoffs, they would be facing an uphill battle against one of the top teams in the West. Without Kobe on the court, there is very little chance of them winning any playoff games.

So what does this mean for Kobe's legacy? He is already considered by many to be one of the greatest players of all time. But with this latest injury, some people may start to question how great he actually was.

Sure, he had an amazing career and won 5 NBA championships, but without this latest injury, his legacy may have been even greater. He would have gone out on top and with little doubt that he was one of the best players ever.

But now with this injury, it appears that his retirement may have come a bit too early. He still has a lot to offer on the court and it will be unfortunate for fans to see him diminished by this injury.

In the end, it will be interesting to see how Lakers' season plays out without Kobe Bryant on the court

#  Will Lakers Struggle Without Kobe's Leadership?

When Kobe Bryant announced his retirement from the NBA, many experts believed that it would be difficult for the Lakers to remain competitive. Without Kobe's leadership on and off the court, could the Lakers crumble?

To start with, the Lakers lost their opening game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. This was not surprising, as Kobe is a player that is very hard to replace. In addition, the Lakers have also had difficulty scoring and maintaining a consistent level of play.

Some people have attributed these struggles to Kobe's absence. They argue that Kobe was a leader on and off the court, and that he motivated his teammates to win. without him, the Lakers lack direction and are unable to gel as a team.

Others argue that the problems plaguing the Lakers are not related to Kobe's retirement at all. Instead, they claim that this season is simply a rebuilding year for the Lakers. The team has been struggling since they lost Dwight Howard in 2013, and there is no guarantee that they will return to form next season.

In any case,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) it will be interesting to see how the Lakers perform in the coming months. If they cannot overcome their difficulties without Kobe's leadership, then it may be time for them to rebuild completely.
