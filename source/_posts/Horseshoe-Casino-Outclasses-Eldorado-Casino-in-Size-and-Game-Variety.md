#  Horseshoe Casino Outclasses Eldorado Casino in Size and Game Variety

The Eldorado Casino, which is located in downtown Reno, has been a popular destination for gamblers since it opened in 1995. However, the Horseshoe Casino, which is located on the north end of the city, has begun to siphon away many of Eldorado’s customers.

The Horseshoe Casino is newer and larger than the Eldorado Casino. It has more than 1,700 slot machines and nearly 60 table games. The Eldorado Casino has only 1,100 slot machines and 36 table games. In addition, the Horseshoe Casino offers a wider variety of games, including blackjack, craps, roulette, and baccarat.

The Eldorado Casino may have been Reno’s first casino resort, but it is no longer the most popular one. The Horseshoe Casino is quickly becoming the go-to destination for gamblers in Reno.

#  Horseshoe Casino vs Eldorado Casino: Who Has the Edge?

When it comes to casino gaming, there are a few big players in the United States. Along with Las Vegas and Atlantic City, Nevada also has Reno and Lake Tahoe. In neighboring California, you have Los Angeles and San Francisco. And then there’s the mighty gambling mecca of Macau in southern China.

In terms of casinos, however, Nevada is king. The Silver State has more than 60 casinos, while California has only about 30. Even though gambling is legal in other parts of the country—including New Jersey, where Atlantic City is located—nevada still dominates in terms of casino revenue.

In this article, we will compare and contrast two of the biggest casinos in Nevada: The Horseshoe Casino in downtown Las Vegas and the Eldorado Casino just outside of Reno. We will take a look at each casino’s history, their amenities, and their gaming floors. We will also compare each casino’s revenues and profits. Finally, we will give our verdict on which casino has the edge.

The Horseshoe Casino is located in downtown Las Vegas on 3rd Street between Stewart and Fremont Avenues. The casino opened its doors to the public on December 14th, 1995. It is owned by Caesars Entertainment Corporation, which also owns other big-name casinos like The Flamingo, Harrah’s Hotel and Casino, and Bally’s Atlantic City.

The Eldorado Casino is located in Sparks, Nevada (just east of Reno) at the intersection of Plumb Lane and south Virginia Street. It first opened its doors to the public on October 1st, 1973. It is owned by Sullivan Gaming Corporation.

The Horseshoe Casino has a total floor space of 102,000 square feet. The Eldorado Casino has a total floor space of 103,000 square feet. However, when it comes to gaming tables and slots machines, the Horseshoe Casino beats out the Eldorado Casino every time. The Horseshoe Casino has 124 gaming tables compared to only 87 for the Eldorado Casino. And when it comes to slots machines, the Horseshoe Casino has 2294 machines compared to only 1327 for the Eldorado Casino.

So far we have seen that the Horseshoe Casino has a larger gaming floor than the Eldorado Casino as well as more gaming tables and slots machines. But how do these two casinos compare when it comes to revenue and profit?

According to figures from 2016 (the most recent year for which data is available), The Horseshoe Casino generated $442 million in revenue while posting a profit of $106 million. By comparison, the Eldorado Casino generated $362 million in revenue but only posted a profit of $14 million. This means that The Horseshoe Casino generates nearly 25% more revenue than the Eldorado Casino while posting over 7 times as much profit! Therefore, we can conclusively say that The Horseshoe Casino has a clear edge over its rival casino in Reno!

#  Which Casino is Larger: Horseshoe or Eldorado?

Eldorado Resort Casino is the largest casino in Nevada, while the Horseshoe Casino is the second largest. The Eldorado is a whopping 108,000 square feet while the Horseshoe clocks in at 95,000 square feet.

Both casinos offer similar games and amenities, but the Eldorado has a slight edge with its non-stop poker room and larger variety of table games. If you’re looking for a massive casino to gamble in, Eldorado is your best bet.

#  Horseshoe Casino vs Eldorado Casino: Which Offers More Games?

When it comes to casino gaming, there are a lot of options to choose from. If you’re looking to compare and contrast two different casinos, the Horseshoe Casino and Eldorado Casino are two good ones to look at. So, what are the differences between these two establishments?

For starters, the Eldorado Casino has more game options. This includes games like craps, roulette, and baccarat. The Horseshoe Casino only offers about half as many games. So if you want variety in your casino gaming experience, the Eldorado is the better option.

Another difference between these two casinos is their minimum bets. At the Eldorado Casino, many of the table games have a minimum bet of $10. At the Horseshoe Casino however, the minimum bets can range from $5-$25. So if you’re looking to play for lower stakes, the Horseshoe Casino may be a better fit for you.

Lastly, both casinos offer promotions and rewards programs. However, the Eldorado Casino’s rewards program is much more generous than the Horseshoe Casino’s. In fact, at Eldorado you can earn rewards points just by playing your favorite slots games! So if you’re looking for some extra perks and bonuses, go with Eldorado casino over Horseshoe casino.

At the end of the day, both casinos have their pros and cons depending on what kind of gamer you are. If you’re looking for a wide variety of games with high minimum bets, go with Eldorado casino. If you’re looking for lower stakes games and some great promos and rewards programs, go with Horseshoe casino!
