#  Pinball Devils Could Mean Big Trouble for Atlantic City Casinos

Atlantic City's casinos have been hurting for a long time, but the latest competition to come to town might just put them out of business. Pinball Devils is a new arcade game that is spreading like wildfire across the East Coast, and it's quickly become the favorite pastime of local gamblers.

The game is simple enough - players use flippers to keep a metal ball in play as it bounces around a series of bumpers and obstacles. But it's incredibly addictive, and people are losing huge sums of money betting on their skill at the game.

Some casino executives are already calling for a ban on the game, but they may be too late. Pinball Devils is quickly becoming popular among millennials and other young people who have no interest in traditional casino games. If the casinos can't find a way to attract this new generation of gamers, they will soon be out of business.

#  Online Gambling Investigation May Target Pinball Game

Online gambling may face another investigation, this time over a pinball game. The game, “Pinball Wizard” by New York-based developer Zen Studios, allows players to use real money to buy in-game rewards.

Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller is considering whether the game falls under Iowa’s gambling laws. Miller said in a statement that the game “appears to skirt the edges” of state law.

The debate over whether “Pinball Wizard” constitutes gambling has been ongoing since the game’s release in October. Some argue that the ability to spend real money on in-game rewards qualifies as gambling, while others claim that the rewards are not valuable enough to constitute gambling.

Zen Studios has defended the game, saying that it does not violate any laws. The company also said that it does not allow players under the age of 18 to participate in its games.

#  New Jersey Officials Investigating Pinball Devils

The New Jersey Attorney General's office is investigating a new arcade game that has players trying to hit devils with a pinball.

The game, called Pinball Devils, has been denounced by some Christian groups as being blasphemous. But creator John Dube says the game is just for fun.

"There's no hidden religious or political message here," Dube said. "I just wanted to make a game that was enjoyable and challenging."

Officials from the Attorney General's office say they are looking into the game to see if it violates any laws.

#  State Looking into Whether Pinball Devils is Gambling

The state of <state> is looking into whether Pinball Devils is gambling. The game, which can be played on desktop and mobile devices, has become popular in recent months.

As of now, it is not clear whether the game constitutes as gambling under state law. A spokesperson for the state Attorney General's office said that the office is currently investigating the game to determine if it fits the definition of gambling.

If the game is determined to be gambling under state law, those running it could face criminal charges. In addition, players could also face criminal charges if they are found to be participating in illegal gambling activities.

It is important to note that just because the state is investigating Pinball Devils does not mean that it is automatically illegal. However, those running or playing the game should be aware of the potential consequences and take appropriate precautions.

#  Could Pinball Devils Lead to Major Gambling Charges?

In the game of pinball, devils are important. They gobble up your balls, and if too many fall into their clutches, you can lose a game.

In Las Vegas, however, the stakes may be much higher for one casino after allegations that its pinball machines are rigged to allow players to win more money than they should.

The state gaming commission is investigating the charges and could levy major fines against the casino or even revoke its license.

This isn't the first time that concerns have been raised about pinball machines in Vegas. In fact, casinos have been using them to cheat patrons for years.

Back in 2014, a group of gamblers filed a lawsuit against three casinos alleging that they had been defrauded by rigged machines. The casinos ended up settling the suit out of court.

The machines used in that case were made by Bally Technologies, which has since been acquired by Scientific Games Corporation. Scientific Games makes most of the machines found in casinos today.

So how do these machines work? And how can players protect themselves from being taken advantage of?

The basic principle behind all slot and video poker machines is that they are designed to give the house a statistical edge over the player. This is known as the "payback percentage."

For example, if a machine has a payback percentage of 98%, it will return $98 for every $100 played on it over the long run. The player will lose $2 for every $100 played.

This isn't to say that everyone who plays these games will lose money – just that on average, they will lose over time. In fact, many people do beat these odds and walk away with some extra cash.

The payback percentage on most pinball machines is actually quite high – usually above 99%. However, there is always a slight chance that something like a devil could snatch away your balls and cost you the game.
