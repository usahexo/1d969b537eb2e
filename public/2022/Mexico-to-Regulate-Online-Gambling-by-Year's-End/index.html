        <h1 id="Mexico-to-Regulate-Online-Gambling-by-Year’s-End"><a href="#Mexico-to-Regulate-Online-Gambling-by-Year’s-End" class="headerlink" title="Mexico to Regulate Online Gambling by Year’s End"></a>Mexico to Regulate Online Gambling by Year’s End</h1><p>Mexico is expected to finalize regulations for online gambling by the end of the year, according to a local news outlet.</p>
<p>The publication El Economista reports that members of the Mexican Senate are close to reaching an agreement on how to tax and license operators in the sector.</p>
<p>If all goes to plan, lawmakers will approve the new regulations before the end of 2018.</p>
<p>This move will mark a significant development in Mexico’s online gambling landscape, as it has been largely unregulated to date.</p>
<p>However, there are indications that legislators are keen to put in place a framework that ensures players are protected and that operators pay their fair share of tax.</p>
<p>Under the proposed regulations, companies will be required to have a license in order to offer online gambling services in Mexico. Licenses will be granted on a case-by-case basis and operators will be subject to a tax rate of 20%.</p>
<p>The new rules will also require operators to protect players against underage gambling and fraud, while ensuring that they have appropriate measures in place to prevent money laundering.</p>
<p>It is understood that lawmakers want to limit the number of licenses granted in order to avoid over-saturation of the market. This is likely to benefit well-established operators such as PokerStars, Bet365 and William Hill, which have already announced their plans to enter the Mexican market.</p>
<h1 id="Mexico-Poised-to-Regulate-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Mexico-Poised-to-Regulate-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Mexico Poised to Regulate Online Gambling"></a>Mexico Poised to Regulate Online Gambling</h1><p>Mexico is on the cusp of regulating online gambling, a move that is expected to provide a much-needed boost to the country’s gaming industry. According to reports, the Mexican government is finalizing regulations that would authorize and license both online casinos and poker sites.</p>
<p>The regulatory framework will be based on the recommendations of a study commissioned by the government last year. The study, which was carried out by Spanish gaming firm Saquilla Consultants, found that legalizing and regulating online gambling could generate as much as $225 million in annual revenue for Mexico.</p>
<p>The Mexican gaming industry has languished in recent years due to a lack of regulation. Only land-based casinos are currently legal in Mexico, and there are just over two dozen of them operating in the country. These casinos are restricted to locals, so bettors have been mostly turning to offshore betting sites to place their wagers.</p>
<p>This has led to a thriving black market for online gambling in Mexico, with some estimates putting the size of the market at more than $1 billion. The new regulations are expected to help legitimize this market and bring in much-needed tax revenue for the Mexican government.</p>
<p>The regulations will likely include a number of restrictions on who can bet and what types of games can be played. For example, only Mexicans aged 18 or older will be allowed to gamble, and only casino games like roulette and blackjack will be allowed. Poker and other sports betting will likely be prohibited.</p>
<p>The new regulations are expected to come into effect sometime in 2019. In the meantime, interested parties can provide feedback on the proposals through an online consultation process that is currently underway.</p>
<h1 id="Mexico-on-the-Verge-of-Regulating-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Mexico-on-the-Verge-of-Regulating-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Mexico on the Verge of Regulating Online Gambling"></a>Mexico on the Verge of Regulating Online Gambling</h1><p>Mexico is on the brink of regulating its burgeoning online gambling industry. The nation’s Congress is currently debating a package of bills that would pave the way for a regulated market.</p>
<p>This would be a significant development, as Mexico has long been considered a haven for unregulated gambling operators. The new legislation would impose a number of regulatory requirements on the industry, including licensing requirements and age verification measures.</p>
<p>It’s not yet clear whether the proposals will pass Congress, but if they do, it could be a game changer for the Mexican online gambling market.</p>
<p>The current state of online gambling in Mexico</p>
<p>Online gambling is currently legal in Mexico, but there is no regulatory framework in place. This has led to a thriving black market, with many unlicensed operators offering their services to Mexican players.</p>
<p>This lack of regulation has resulted in a number of problems for players and providers alike. There are no age verification measures in place, meaning that children can easily access offshore gambling sites. There are also no consumer protection measures in place, meaning that players are vulnerable to scams and fraud.</p>
<p>In addition, the lack of regulation has resulted in a number of tax evasion issues. Many offshore operators don’t pay taxes on their profits, which costs the government millions of dollars each year.</p>
<p>Why regulate online gambling?</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why Mexico might want to regulate its online gambling industry. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To protect players from scams and fraud; </p>
</li>
<li><p>To protect children from accessing inappropriate content; </p>
</li>
<li><p>To generate tax revenue from the industry; </p>
</li>
<li><p>To ensure that operators are complying with safety and consumer protection measures; </p>
</li>
<li><p>To create a level playing field for licensed operators.</p>
</li>
</ul>

This new development is expected to significantly boost Mexico’s gaming industry and create many new jobs.</p>
<p>The Mexican government has been working on the regulations for quite some time now, and it appears that everything is finally in place. The proposed regulations will allow both foreign and domestic companies to offer online gambling services in Mexico.</p>
<p>Foreign gaming companies have been lobbying for a piece of the Mexican online gambling market for many years now. In fact, several of them have already established operations in other Latin American countries such as Brazil and Argentina.</p>
<p>The new regulations are expected to generate over MXN$800 million ($42 million) in tax revenue each year. This money will be used to fund programs aimed at promoting responsible gambling among Mexicans.</p>
<p>According to Mexico’s Secretary of Economy Ildefonso Guajardo, the new regulations will also create thousands of new jobs in the country’s gaming industry. “We are convinced that this measure will generate thousands of jobs and millions in investment, mostly from abroad, which is why we have worked so hard on it these past few months,” he said.</p>
<p>The Mexican Gaming Institute (IMJ) is currently working on a list of approved online gambling operators. The list is expected to be released soon, and interested companies can start applying for licenses shortly thereafter.</p>
